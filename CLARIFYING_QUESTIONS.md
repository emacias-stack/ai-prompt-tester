# Clarifying Questions - Porsche Car Events Application

## User Experience Expectations

1. **Mobile vs Desktop Usage**
   - What percentage of users do you expect to access the app via mobile devices vs desktop?
   - Should we prioritize mobile-first design or desktop-first?

2. **Event Scope & Focus**
   - Should the app focus exclusively on Porsche events, or include broader car culture events with Porsche-specific filtering?
   - What types of events are most important (car shows, track days, meets, auctions, etc.)?

3. **Geographic Coverage**
   - What geographic regions should the app cover initially (local, regional, national, international)?
   - Should we start with a specific city/region and expand?

## Performance & Scale Requirements

4. **User Base & Load**
   - What's the expected user base size and concurrent user load for the MVP?
   - Do you have any existing community or audience we can leverage?

5. **Data Volume**
   - How many events do you expect to be listed simultaneously (hundreds, thousands)?
   - What's the expected growth rate for events and users?

6. **Real-time Requirements**
   - Do you need real-time updates for event changes, or is periodic refresh acceptable?
   - Should users receive instant notifications for new events or changes?

## Integration & Technical Needs

7. **Third-party Integrations**
   - Should the app integrate with existing event platforms (Eventbrite, Facebook Events) or be completely standalone?
   - Do you want to import events from other sources or rely on manual entry?

8. **Payment & Monetization**
   - Will events require ticket purchases, or is this primarily for free events and meetups?
   - What's the planned revenue model (subscriptions, event fees, advertising, premium features)?

## Business & Content Strategy

9. **Content Management**
   - How will you handle user-generated content and ensure event quality?
   - Who will be responsible for content moderation and event verification?

10. **Competitive Positioning**
    - How do you want to differentiate from existing platforms like Eventbrite or Meetup?
    - What unique value proposition should we emphasize?

## Additional Considerations

11. **Event Organizer Tools**
    - Do you need tools for event organizers to manage their events and attendees?
    - Should organizers have their own dashboards and analytics?

12. **Community Features**
    - How important are social features like user profiles, reviews, and community discussions?
    - Should we include features for connecting users with similar interests?
