## 3. Clarifying Questions

### User Experience Expectations
1. **Mobile vs Desktop**: What percentage of users do you expect to access the app via mobile devices vs desktop?
2. **Event Types**: Should the app focus exclusively on Porsche events, or include broader car culture events with Porsche-specific filtering?
3. **Geographic Scope**: What geographic regions should the app cover initially (local, regional, national, international)?

### Performance Requirements
4. **User Load**: What's the expected user base size and concurrent user load for the MVP?
5. **Data Volume**: How many events do you expect to be listed simultaneously (hundreds, thousands)?
6. **Real-time Features**: Do you need real-time updates for event changes, or is periodic refresh acceptable?

### Integration Needs
7. **Third-party Services**: Should the app integrate with existing event platforms (Eventbrite, Facebook Events) or be completely standalone?
8. **Payment Processing**: Will events require ticket purchases, or is this primarily for free events and meetups?

### Business Constraints
9. **Monetization**: What's the planned revenue model (subscriptions, event fees, advertising, premium features)?
10. **Content Moderation**: How will you handle user-generated content and ensure event quality?

## 4. Feature Prioritization

## 5. Technical Architecture Suggestions

### Frontend Architecture
```typescript
// Recommended structure
src/
├── components/
│   ├── common/
│   ├── events/
│   ├── users/
│   └── admin/
├── pages/
├── hooks/
├── services/
├── types/
└── utils/
```

### Backend Architecture
```javascript
// Recommended structure
src/

└── config/
```

### Database Schema (High-level)
```sql
-- Core tables
users (id, email, name, preferences, created_at)
events (id, title, description, location, date, organizer_id, category)
attendances (user_id, event_id, status, created_at)
reviews (id, user_id, event_id, rating, comment, created_at)
```

## 6. Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **Scalability Issues**
   - Risk: Performance degradation with user growth
   - Mitigation: Implement caching, CDN, database optimization

2. **Data Quality**
   - Risk: Inaccurate or outdated event information
   - Mitigation: Admin verification, user reporting, automated checks

3. **Security Vulnerabilities**
   - Risk: User data breaches, unauthorized access
   - Mitigation: Input validation, authentication, HTTPS, regular security audits

### Business Risks
1. **User Adoption**
   - Risk: Low user engagement and retention
   - Mitigation: Focus on core value proposition, user feedback loops

2. **Content Moderation**
   - Risk: Inappropriate content or spam
   - Mitigation: Community guidelines, reporting system, admin oversight

3. **Competition**
   - Risk: Existing platforms improving their car event features
   - Mitigation: Focus on Porsche-specific niche, superior UX

## 7. Development Recommendations
